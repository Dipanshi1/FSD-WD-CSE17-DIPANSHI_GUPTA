    <h4>TOM & JERRY</h4>
    <p>Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon where a cat (Tom) constantly chases a clever mouse (Jerry). The show is famous for its slapstick comedy, clever tricks, and almost no dialogue, making it funny for all ages and cultures. Over the years, it’s had many versions — from the original 1940s shorts to modern shows and movies — but the main idea always stays the same: the endless, hilarious battle between Tom and Jerry.</p>
